## February 14, 2017: last three problems from Hackerrank RookieRank2

Problems: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/rookierank-2/challenges

in order of difficulty:  
* https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/rookierank-2/challenges/hackerrank-in-a-string
* https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/rookierank-2/challenges/knightl-on-chessboard
* https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/rookierank-2/challenges/prefix-neighbors

In my C++ solutions, I use `#define ll long long`, so `ll` everywhere in the code represents `long long`.
