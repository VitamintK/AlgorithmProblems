[Educational Codeforces Round 93](https://codeforces.com/contest/1398)

solved 4/7

rank 1537 out of X

5 incorrect submissions for D because I thought greedy would work, and then because python and pypy were too slow, so I rewrote it in Go.

Problem titles:
- Bad Triangle
- Substring Removal Game
- Good Subarrays
- Colored Rectangles

and then I couldn't do E because neither python nor golang has a BST in the stdlib ;_;

I guess I really do need to pick up C++ again ;_;
