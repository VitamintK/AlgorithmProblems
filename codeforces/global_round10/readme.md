[Global Round 10](https://codeforces.com/contest/1392)

fuuuuuck I used python/pypy for problem B which had 2*10^5 inputs and it TLEd ;_;

lesson learned: I'm never using python for codeforces again, except for trivial problems where n << TLE
(especially reading inputs?  maybe pypy is especially slow at that?)

other than that, solved A, C, D, E (4/9)

Problem titles:  
- Omkar and Password
- Omkar and Infinity Clock
- Omkar and Waterslide
- Omkar and Bed Wars
- Omkar and Duck
- Omkar and Landslide
- ...

Saw one guy hack a lot of Bs so I tried but couldn't find the hack case so I got 2 incorrect hacks
