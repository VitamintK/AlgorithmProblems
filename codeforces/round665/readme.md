round 665: https://codeforces.com/contest/1401/my

rank 2671, went down from 1711 mmr to 1696 mmr

I solved A, B, and C, but failed on D.  My only mistake on D was to sort arrays after I modded the values by 10^9+7.

I sorted to reverse the factors array after modding the values, and the only way I knew how to reverse an array in golang
was to sort the array in reverse.  I fixed it after the contest and it worked :'(


Problems:
- Distance and Axis
- Ternary Sequence
- Mere Array
- Maximum Distributed Tree
