[Round 1](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup/2020/round-1)

371 / 13,820, advanced to round 2

finished A1, A3, and B

1741 people qualified.

I did A1 and then A3 (accidentally), and then when I did A2 I didn't think about it enough and so my solution was N^2 when I got my full input.  
Unfortunately the format of hacker cup is that you can't try again, so I wasted my opportunity.

My solution for A2 and A3 required BSTs, so I was about to resign myself to picking up C++ again, but realized that I could use a 3rd party BST library for python, which worked out really really well.

I thought my solution for B was good, but they announced that the problem was actually flawed, probably because mine (and the intended solution) assumed
a left-to-right matching would always work, but it fails [in cases like this](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/81418?#comment-681795)

Oh well, they still gave me points for it.

I didn't try C because I had plans that day, but probably wouldn't have solved it anyways.
