I did pretty good in this contest.  

Solved A and B for 634th out of 1,737.
Had about 90 minuts to spare after solving B, and I spent a long time and eventually figured out a soln for C.
Ran out of time in the contest while implementing it though; was probably around 20 minutes away from getting it to work.

Even if I solved it at the very end of the contest, it'd still only be good for 370ishth place, and only top 200 advance to the next.

However, anyone who solved a problem here earned a t-shirt, so I guess I got one.

I should have been faster on A since it was pretty trivial, but I fucked up copy-pasting my input-reading code from round 1 so it took me 32 minutes.  
I gotta learn to be faster for B too, since it took me a further hour, but top people solved it in 10 minutes.  Fun problem though.
