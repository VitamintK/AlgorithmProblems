took me bout an hour to come up with the soln for A (kept thinking I was doing it wrong and thinking there must be some easy way to solve the x = n*(n+1)/2 quadratic equation but from the editorials this was actually essentially the intended solution) and debug it.
then it took me a while to come up with a soln for B easy, and I ran out of time while writing it.
Ended up just solving A hard.
Needed to solve both A hard and B hard within a good enough time to pass :(
