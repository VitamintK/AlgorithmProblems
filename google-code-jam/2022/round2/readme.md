Hm... very unusual contest!

A was, in my opinion, a very subpar problem by Code Jam standards. It was a drag that took me 70 minutes to correctly implement (even though it's a stupidly easy problem that requires no insight at all! just pure implementation!). It even took most of the top solvers anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hr as well.

Like... if a problem is stupid easy, it shouldn't be taking grandmasters 20 minutes and definitely not 1 hr to implement. As opposed to Codejam problems in the past which were all really fun. (It also was unclear if A required O(n) or merely O(N^2) to solve, since N^2 was 10^8 in this case. Ah, I guess it's because T=100, so T*N^2 will be 10^10.)

Anyways, strange contest because A had 1.7k full solves (w an additional 1k partial solves, probably because they didn't notice the T*N^2 problem), B had only 222 full solves, C had only 123 full solves, and D had only 17(!) full solves.

B partial was stupid easy (2.4k solves). Commenters say that C partial and D partial were also easy, but I didn't get to look at D, and I actually couldn't figure out C partial. 

I came up with the idea to C full with ~15 minutes left, but wasn't sure if it was right, and I didn't have the full solution (I thought the answer might be to take an arbitrary bipartite matching under the blueberryless constraints, and then convert it to a satisfying matching, but wasn't sure how to do the conversion or if a valid conversion always exists). I tried thinking of a C partial solution, and came up with the "try any ordering" answer, but couldn't figure out how to resolve ties (apparently you can resolve ties arbitrarily, but consistently: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/102849?#comment-912518 but you can only be confident this works if you think a lot more and by then you basically have the full solution) so I didn't end up getting it.

I would have thought that my terrible performance (A full and B partial) would have been good for 4000th place or so, but I actually ended up with 1089th place. On one hand this is pretty good, almost top 1000. On the other hand, it's not top 1000, so I neither move on nor get a t-shirt. And the fact that I was so close means that I could have just solved the problems that I did a bit faster and actually qualified! If I didn't eat lunch or get distracted or if I just coded the easy solution faster or didn't get time penalty, I would have my first t-shirt! Or if I tried D partial! Anyways, problem C was fun, problem A was dogshit. I'll get 'em next time.
