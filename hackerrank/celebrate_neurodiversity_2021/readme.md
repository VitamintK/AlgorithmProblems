Only US-based competitors were eligible for prizes.

This was a contest that ran over a weekend, but anyone could choose a 3-hour window that they wanted to compete in.  I thought the timer started as soon as the contest was released, so I started it ASAP.

Out of the competitors who started as soon as the contest launched: I first place out of the 75 or so competitors who submitted at least 1 problem, and the 156 or so total registrants.

By the end of the weekend, I was in 2nd place (technically 3rd place but the 1st place guy cheated).

Since the one person who beat me had already won a prize this year, I think I qualified for the first place prize!
