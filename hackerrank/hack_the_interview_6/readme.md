I got 3rd place for the prize of $100
I think I might have gotten 2nd but the first problem was bugged (testcases' input format was different than what was described in problem description and had to be guessed)

A: Array-sum Operation  
B: 0-1 Graph  
C: Constructing a Tree
D: Solving for Queries with Cups (really easy... maintain positions with a set, then do static range queries.  since the queries are on a static array, we can just binary search it to find the correct index for each query.)
