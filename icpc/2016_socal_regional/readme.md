Our actual code from ICPC socal November 2016 regional  
we got 6th place.  
UCI Map (trailblazers): Linh, Karthik, and me (Kevin)

We solved problems 1-8, and didn't come up with a solution for 9, and ran out of time on 10 (no team solved problem 10 :( )  If you use this for training, then you're welcome.  Note: our solutions (besides 10) all passed the official judge, but there are more optimal solutions than ours for problems like problem 8 and maybe 7.  They passed because there was a very long time limit at regionals (60 seconds) so we slipped on by.  Dunno if we're allowed to post these so please contact me if you want these taken down.
