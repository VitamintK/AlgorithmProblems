94 / 13949

for some reason problems A and B were really hard/tedious for what should be trivial problems.

Took me 18 minutes to solve the first two and I got a bug on B xD

C was hard too, but not tedious.  took me 14 minuts to get the insight and solve the problem

For D I coded a bespoke BST and cached combinations calculator so it took a bit (dunno if cached combinations was needed?)

Problems:

Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times 

Maximum Length of Subarray With Positive Product 

Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island

Number of Ways to Reorder Array to Get Same BST
